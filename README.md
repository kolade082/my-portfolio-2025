# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a Software Engineer. The website is built using **React** with support for **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** and **Animations**.

## Features

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes based on your preference. The theme is saved in local storage, so it persists across sessions.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for different sections of the page using **Framer Motion**.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is mobile-friendly and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
